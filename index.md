I am a Doctoral Candidate in the [Department of Communication at UCSB](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/), senior data scientist at UCSB's [Media Neuroscience Lab](http://www.medianeuroscience.org/) (PI: Rene Weber, PhD, MD), and an associate of the [NSF IGERT Network Science Program](https://networkscience.igert.ucsb.edu/). My [research](https://fhopp.github.io/research) leverages natural language processing, computational modeling, and neuroscientific methodologies to examine how latent moral information and moral conflict permeates human narratives and motivates actions. 

In previous research, I examined the role of cognitive and perceptual load on multimedia processing, assessed the role of entertainment experiences for processing political messages, studied the effects of cyber-ostracism in social media environments, and explored the motivational correlates of permanent online connectedness. 
       
My work has been published in scientific journals including _Journal of Communication_, _Computers in Human Behavior_, _Communication Methods and Measures_, _Computational Communication Research_, and _Mass Communication and Society_. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Media Psychology with a minor in Political Science from the [University of Mannheim](http://mkw.uni-mannheim.de/) and a Master of Arts in Communication from the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/).
