I am Assistant Professor for Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam's School of Communication Research. I am interested in the moral content of human communication and how moralized messages are cognitively processed and motivate behavior. My recent work studies how moral information is represented in patterns of neural activity and guides moral judgment. I leverage a method-theory synergy that combines behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, natural language processing, and machine learning.
       
My work has been published in scientific journals including _Nature Human Behavior_, _Computers in Human Behavior_, _Behavior Research Methods_, _Journal of Communication_, _Communication Methods and Measures_, and _Computational Communication Research_. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I worked as a data scientist in Dr. Rene Weber's Media Neuroscience Lab.
