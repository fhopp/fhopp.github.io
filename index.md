I am Assistant Professor for Political Communication (tenured, 2022) at the [University of Amsterdam's School of Communication Research](https://ascor.uva.nl/). My [research](https://fhopp.github.io/research) examines how **morality** permeates human **communication**, is represented in the **brain**, and motivates **action**. I leverage theory-driven applications of multiple methodologies that include behavioral experiments, machine learning, and neuroimaging.
       
My work has been published in scientific journals including _Nature Human Behavior_, _Computers in Human Behavior_, _Behavior Research Methods_, _Journal of Communication_, _Communication Methods and Measures_, and _Computational Communication Research_. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Media Psychology with a minor in Political Science from the [University of Mannheim](http://mkw.uni-mannheim.de/) and completed my Ph.D. at the [Department of Communication at UCSB](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/), where I worked as a data scientist at UCSB's [Media Neuroscience Lab](http://www.medianeuroscience.org/) (PI: Rene Weber, PhD, MD),
