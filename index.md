I am tenured Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam's School of Communication Research. I primarily investigate how morality permeates human communication and how moralized messages are cognitively processed and motivate behavior. 
My recent work studies how neural activation patterns give rise to moral decisions, and how large language models align with humans' moral judgments. To advance my research, I leverage a combination of natural language processing, functional neuroimaging, machine learning, and (large-scale) behavorial experiments. 
       
My work has been published in scientific journals including [_Nature Human Behavior_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01693-8), [_Journal of Communication_](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/70/3/335/5855533), [_Behavior Research Methods_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-020-01433-0), [_Communication Methods & Measures_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19312458.2018.1447656), and [_Computational Communication Research_](https://www.aup-online.com/content/journals/10.5117/CCR2019.1.002.HOPP). I completed my Ph.D. in communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I worked as a data scientist in Dr. Rene Weber's Media Neuroscience Lab. 

Besides research, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112029473-frederic-hopp), playing guitar and piano, endurance sports, hiking, and brewing coffee.
