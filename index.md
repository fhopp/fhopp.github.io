## Welcome!

Frederic is a PhD student in the [Department of Communication at UCSB](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/) and an associate of the [NSF IGERT Network Science Program](https://networkscience.igert.ucsb.edu/). In his current research, Frederic applies a combination of state-of-the-art natural-language-processing and machine learning techniques to extract and classify the latent moral content permeating a variety of media narratives, such as online newspaper articles or movie scripts. By combining these content analytical measures with neural responses arising from individuals' perceptions of moral violations and moral conflicts, Frederic adopts a “brain-as-predictor” approach to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving large-scale behavioural outcomes, such as message virality and moral outrage, movie box office sales, or the spatio-temporal patterns of social unrest and protest movements. His work has been published in renown communication journals and been presented at both academic, as well as commercial organisations, such as Sony Pictures. 

Before attending UCSB, Frederic held several research assistant positions at the Institute of Media and Communication Studies at the University of Mannheim, where he worked with Prof. Dr. Peter Vorderer to investigate the role of entertainment experiences for the processing of political talk shows, the effects of cyberostracism in social media environments, as well as the motivational correlates of permanent online connectedness. Frederic holds a BA in Media and Communication Studies with a minor in Political Science from the [University of Mannheim](http://mkw.uni-mannheim.de/).
