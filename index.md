I am Assistant Professor for Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam's School of Communication Research. I investigate how morality permeates human communication and how moralized messages are cognitively processed and motivate behavior. 
My recent work studies how morality is represented in patterns of neural activity and guides moral judgment. I am also interested in the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). My work leverages a method-theory synergy that combines behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and computational social science. 
       
My work has been published in scientific journals including [_Nature Human Behavior_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01693-8), [_Journal of Communication_](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/70/3/335/5855533), [_Behavior Research Methods_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-020-01433-0), and [_Computational Communication Research_](https://www.aup-online.com/content/journals/10.5117/CCR2019.1.002.HOPP). I completed my Ph.D. in communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I worked as a data scientist in Dr. Rene Weber's Media Neuroscience Lab.
