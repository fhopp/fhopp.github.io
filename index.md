I am an Assistant Professor for Political Communication at the [Amsterdam School of Communication Research](https://ascor.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). My [research](https://fhopp.github.io/research) integrates natural language processing and computational modeling with traditional social scientific and neuroscientific methodologies to examine how moral information permeates human narratives and motivates actions. Specifically, I am currently examining how moralized political communication affects polarization processes. This work primarily informs intervention campaigns aimed at depolarizing national and global societies. 

In previous research, I examined the role of cognitive and perceptual load on multimedia processing, assessed the impact of entertainment experiences on processing political messages, studied the effects of cyber-ostracism in social media environments, and explored the motivational correlates of permanent online connectedness. 
       
My work has been published in scientific journals including _Journal of Communication_, _Behavior Research Methods_, _Computers in Human Behavior_, _Communication Methods and Measures_, _Computational Communication Research_, and _Mass Communication and Society_. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Media Psychology with a minor in Political Science from the [University of Mannheim](http://mkw.uni-mannheim.de/) and completed my M.A./PH.D. training  at the [Department of Communication at UCSB](http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/), where I worked as a data scientist at UCSB's [Media Neuroscience Lab](http://www.medianeuroscience.org/) (PI: Rene Weber, PhD, MD),
