### Resources & Helpful Links

Here, I mainly provide access to resources that I have either put together myself or found on the web and considered helpful.

### Graduate School and Science Survival

A few book tips that helped me throughout graduate school. 

* [A PhD Is Not Enough: A Guide To Survival In Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587478.A_PhD_Is_Not_Enough)
* [The Professor Is In: The Essential Guide To Turning Your Ph.D. Into a Job ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24811991-the-professor-is-in?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=CCSYKC4zhl&rank=1)
* [The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204378-the-book-of-why?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=tUhhcGEa3o&rank=1)
 
### Coding and Programming 

While I strongly believe in an applied, trial-and-error approach to learning how to program (ideally with some well-defined problem in mind), the following works helped me a lot to develop a basic understanding of programming and machine-learning concepts:

* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
* [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.datascienceassn.org/sites/default/files/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Python.pdf)
* [Python Machine Learning](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book)
